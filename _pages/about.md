I'm a 2024 master's graduate from [ChangSha Univercity of Science and Technology](https://www.csust.edu.cn/ywb/Home.htm).My research focused on applying reinforcement learning algorithms to path planning for AUVs.

You can find my CV here: [Zhao Liang's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/ZhaoLiang_CV.pdf)
